## I know nothing about web components, where should I start?

- Here is a great talk by Rob Dodson talking about what the development process looks like when building web components with Polymer: [End to End with Polymer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1f_Tj_JnStA)

- Once you get the general concept you're going to want to start building something. There is a really good [getting started tutorial](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/start/first-element/intro) on the Polymer website.

- Now that you kind of understand how the Polymer world works you're going to dive into watching as many Polycasts videos that you possibly can.  Starting with these:

  - [Polymer CLI: Getting Started -- Polycasts #48](https://youtu.be/pj2lmXVa84U)
  - [Give your element an API -- Polycasts #16](https://youtu.be/7jolqbtIdiY?list=PLNYkxOF6rcIDdS7HWIC_BYRunV6MHs5xo)
