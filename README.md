# LRN Ontology
A working ontology for how LRN works, the elements contained and what purpose they serve. LRN is broken down into three families of custom elements / ontologies:
## lrn
This is what people would add into an html field. It's the instructionally focused element, told to render a certain way. Examples would be readable by the lay-person such as <lrn-assignment label="Assignment 1"> or <lrn-lesson number="1" label="Introduction to Polymer" icon="myicon.png">. These elements have no connotation of design on their own and so each needs to utilize a design such as `design="card"` attribute in order to be presented to users.
## lrndesign
This is for the visual representation of an instructional concept (because instruction needs designed). This makes the instructional component visually make sense to end users. Examples of this would be things like <lrndesign-card> or <lrndesign-imagegallery>. lrndesign components COULD be used on their own to represent information though the preference is towards supplying visualization to items in an instructionally significant manner. For example, instead of an imagegallery, using a <lrn-examples display="imagegallery">{<img tags in here/>}</lrn-examples> in order to provide examples or highlight instructional resources in some manner.
## lrnsys
These elements are for providing systematic design integrations as well as reusable elements across other design components. These are things that aren't really designed to work on their own but to help inform the usage of other components. Examples of this would be a <lrnsys-progress> which could visualize data about progression or <lrnsys-contextmenu> which could provide a standard way of presenting contextual menu items. These are structural atoms that wouldn't be used on their own.
