# oer-schema
OER Schema is a related community project. One of the goals of LRN is to seemlessly integrate OERSchema in such a way that end-users are writing pedagogically relevant content that by the descisions of tag choice are also informing machines about the educational significance of the material.

This tag / series of tags will be fleshed out as it makes sense, currently it's a simple wrapper tag that ensures that the material has `<div prefix="oer: http://oerschema.org/">` appended to it.
